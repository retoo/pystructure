(Goal engine, why \& how) \\
(link to other possible solutions)
Correctness \& Usefulness \\
Process Overview \\

\section{Parsing the Source Code}
 From Source Code to AST (Jython)

\section{Creating the Model}
From AST to Model \\
(StructureVisitor, DefinitionVisitor)\\
Connecting Definitions and Uses\\
(What's already known, what not (attributes...))\\


\section{Inferencing Types}
Goal Engine \\
 (description of the goal engine)\\
 (advantages/disadvantages)\\
Evaluation\\
 (goals \& evaluators explained)\\
 (examples)\\


\section{Challenges/Problems}
Container Element Types \\
Call Context \& Instance Context \\
Built-in Types \& Functions\\
Inheritance\\
 (C3 MRO)\\
Recursion\\

\section{Caching}
 Techniques, Performance, advantages/disadvantages, problems
 Result, problems, performance, memory requirements (ganzer ti)
\section{Improvements During the Development}
 (DLTK \& goalengine refactoring) \\
 (Avoid casting (result in Goal))\\
 (Goaltype -> Evaluator Map)\\
Other Type Inference Solutions\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Structural Analysis}
How to interpret the information provided by the TI \\
What kind of relations \\
What kind of elements (Module, class, etc. mapping to s101g) \\
How does the output look like \\
Parsing a single expression vs inference all expressions (demand driven vs everything)\\
 what are `all expressions`\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item to Peter Sommerlad and Thomas Corbat for their support during the project
	\item to Christian Bachmann for the life-saving coffee machine in our study room. 
	\item NOT to HSR for their banning of the above mentioned life-saving coffee machine out of the study room\footnote{They actually banned it after a few weeks, but as we operated the coffee machine well hidden in a closet it wasn't discovered by the facility management)}
\end{itemize}
